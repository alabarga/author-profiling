## Instruction to use `test.py`

Use it to convert a document to CSV of its features.

* Have the input document saved in a file. Here we take that as `input_01.txt`.
* Run `python tast.py [file_name]`.
* The resulting CSV will be saved in `[file_name].out`.

eg. `python test.py input_01.txt` will generate csv in `input_01.out`
