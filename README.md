# Author Profiling

Predicting Gender and Age of the author using semantic features

This project involves predicting personal information of authors like gender, age etc by training classifiers using content based and semantic features extracted from a KB like
Wikipedia. There is a lot of contextual difference between blogs written by different people. This project will explore those contextual differences to predict age and gender of an author of a text. It
basically consists of two phases:

1. Semantic representation of documents. This can be done by linking the entities to
Wikipedia and mapping semantically related words to Wikipedia Category Network

2. Age and Gender prediction. This can be done by using any ML classifiers like SVM or
KNN.
