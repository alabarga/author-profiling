# Author Profiling from Personal Content Blogs

## Abstract

This project aims to predicting personally identifiable infor-
mation (PII), such as age and gender of the author by ex-
tracting features from his/her personal content blog texts.
We intend to define the state-of-the-art in the field and over-
come the shortcomings of the prior works in the personality
recognition tasks. This report describes our progress so far
and contains details about our future work-flow.

## Introduction

Though the enormous impact of social media on our daily
life, we observe a lack of information about those who create
the contents. In this regard, author profiling tries to deter-
mine the gender, age, native language or personality type of
authors by analyzing their published texts. In this study, we
focus on building a system to identify only the gender and
age of the authors. Other authorship details will be a part of
the future work in this area. Author profiling is of growing
importance: E.g., from a marketing viewpoint, companies
may be interested in knowing the demographics of their tar-
get group in order to achieve a better market segmentation;
from a forensic viewpoint, determining the linguistic profile
of a person who wrote a ”suspicious text” may provide valu-
able background information.

This study is targeted towards partial fulfillment of require-
ments for CS60057: Speech & Natural Language Processing
during Fall 2015, under the guidance of Prof. Pawan Goyal.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 describes the corpus, Section 3 covers the proposed
approach, Section 4 presents the results obtained so far, Sec-
tion 5 discusses the evaluation measures, Section 6 contains
details about the future work-plan and Section 7 concludes
by listing the work done by the individual team-mates.
